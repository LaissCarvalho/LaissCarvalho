Our greatest enemies are the ";" that we meet along the way...

## Hi there! i'm LaÃ­s Carvalho ðŸ‘‹
Iâ€™m learning programming, and even though Iâ€™m not a professional yet, I really want to pursue a career in this field. I enjoy learning little by little, understanding how things work, and seeing my progress over time. I donâ€™t just code to build a career, I also do it out of curiosity and pure enjoyment.
